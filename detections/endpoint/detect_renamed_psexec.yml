description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of `PsExec.exe` being
  utilized on an endpoint. Most instances, it is highly probable to capture `Psexec.exe`
  or other SysInternal utility usage with the command-line argument of `-accepteula`.
  In this instance, we are using `OriginalFileName` from Sysmon to identify `PsExec`
  usage. During triage, validate this is the legitimate version of `PsExec` by review
  the PE metadata. In addition, review parallel processes for further suspicious behavior.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 (OriginalFileName=psexec.c process_name!=psexec.exe process_name!=PsExec64.exe)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, User,
  parent_process_name, process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine Product
  | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_renamed_psexec_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present. It is possible some
  third party applications may use older versions of PsExec, filter as needed.

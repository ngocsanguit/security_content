description: this search is to detect a suspicious office product process that spawn
  cmd child process. This is commonly seen in a ms office product having macro to
  execute shell command to download or execute malicious lolbin relative to its malicious
  code. This is seen in trickbot spear phishing doc where it execute shell cmd to
  run mshta payload.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "winword.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name= "excel.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name
  = "powerpnt.exe") Processes.process_name=cmd.exe by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name

  | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `office_product_spawn_cmd_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: IT or network admin may create an document automation that
  will run shell script.

description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of rundll32.exe executing.
  rundll32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. During
  investigation, validate it is the legitimate rundll32.exe executing and what script
  content it is loading. This query relies on the OriginalFileName from Sysmon, or
  internal name from the PE meta data. Expand the query as needed by looking for specific
  command line arguments outlined in other analytics.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 OriginalFileName=RUNDLL32.EXE NOT process_name=rundll32.exe
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, User,
  parent_process_name, process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine |
  rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `suspicious_rundll32_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of rundll32, triggering a false positive.

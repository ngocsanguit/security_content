description: The following analytic identifies renamed 7-Zip usage using Sysmon. At
  this stage of an attack, review parallel processes and file modifications for data
  that is staged or potentially have been exfiltrated. This analytic utilizes the
  OriginalFileName to capture the renamed process.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 (OriginalFileName=7z*.exe AND process_name!=7z*.exe) |
  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, User, parent_process_name,
  process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine | rename Computer as dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_renamed_7_zip_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives, however this analytic will need to
  be modified for each environment if Sysmon is not used.

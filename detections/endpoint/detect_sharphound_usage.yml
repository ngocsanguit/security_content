description: The following analytic identifies SharpHound binary usage by using the
  `OriginalFileName` from Sysmon. In addition to renaming the PE, other coverage is
  available to detect command-line arguments. This particular analytic only looks
  for the OriginalFileName of `SharpHound.exe`. It is possible older instances of
  SharpHound.exe have different original filenames. Dependent upon the operator, the
  code may be re-compiled and the attributes removed or changed to anything else.
  During triage, review the metadata of the binary in question. Review parallel processes
  for suspicious behavior. Identify the source of this binary.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 (OriginalFileName=SharpHound.exe process_name!=sharphound.exe)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, User,
  parent_process_name, process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine Product
  | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_sharphound_usage_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is specific to a
  file attribute not used by anything else. Filter as needed.

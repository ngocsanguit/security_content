description: The following analytic identifies renamed instances of msbuild.exe executing.
  Msbuild.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 and
  C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319. During investigation, identify
  the code executed and what is executing a renamed instance of MSBuild.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 (OriginalFileName=msbuild.exe process_name!=msbuild.exe)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, User,
  parent_process_name, process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path, CommandLine |
  rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `suspicious_msbuild_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of msbuild, triggering a false positive.

description: The following analtyic identifies renamed instances of `WinRAR.exe`.
  In most cases, it is not common for WinRAR to be used renamed, however it is common
  to be installed by a third party application and executed from a non-standard path.
  In this instance, we are using `OriginalFileName` from Sysmon to determine if the
  process is WinRAR. During triage, validate additional metadata from the binary that
  this is `WinRAR`. Review parallel processes and file modifications.
search: '`sysmon` EventID=1 (Product=WinRAR OR OriginalFileName=WinRAR.exe) process_name!=rar.exe
  process_name!=winrar.exe | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime
  by Computer, User, parent_process_name, process_name, OriginalFileName, process_path,
  CommandLine Product | rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_renamed_winrar_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Modify query for specific EDR products as needed.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible third party applications use renamed
  instances of WinRAR.
